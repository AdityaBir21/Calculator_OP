A basic calculator created with HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript is a simple web application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The HTML provides the structure of the calculator, including buttons for numbers and operations, and a display area for showing input and results. CSS is used to style the calculator, making it visually appealing and easy to use. JavaScript handles the functionality, responding to user input, performing calculations, and updating the display with results. This kind of project is great for learning and demonstrating fundamental web development skills.
